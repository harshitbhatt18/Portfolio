HOW TO ADD YOUR PROFILE IMAGE:

Method 1: Upload to public folder (Recommended)
1. Add your image file to the public folder (e.g., public/harshit-photo.jpg)
2. Update src/data/portfolio.ts:
   image: "/harshit-photo.jpg"

Method 2: Use external hosting
1. Upload your image to:
   - GitHub (raw.githubusercontent.com)
   - ImgBB (i.ibb.co)
   - Cloudinary
   - Any other image hosting service
2. Update src/data/portfolio.ts with the direct image URL

Method 3: Convert Google Drive link
If you want to use Google Drive:
1. Share your image and get the file ID from the URL
2. Use this format: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID
3. Make the file publicly viewable

Note: Google Drive sharing links (with /view?usp=sharing) don't work directly with Next.js Image component.
